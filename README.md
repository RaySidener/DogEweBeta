# DogEweBeta
## A little like WolfRamAlpha, but the knockoff version

#### **What it does now**
- Basically, solves systems of linear equations for x equations/variables
  - Prompts user for equation metadata (ie, how many equations/variables?) and equations
  themselves
  - Processes the equations
  - Creates an augmented matrix representing the system of equations
  - Puts the matrix in reduced row echelon form
  - Prints out the solution to the system

#### **Things I plan to add**
- Better formatted output
  - including output for systems with no solutions/multiple solutions
- other fun mathy features?! (maybe)
  - simplify expressions and equations that aren't fully simplified?
  - solve equations with one variable?
  - solve *quadratics??*??? (maybe someday)
